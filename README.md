# jpfm-chef-cookbooks
This is the main repo for the Chef-based configuration management automation code used at JPFM Labs. 

This automation code is built on the [attribute-driven-API cookbooks](https://github.com/facebook/chef-cookbooks) maintained by Facebook. This model for using configuration management is not the typical way people use configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc. Also, this model for using Chef is not the traditional way most people use Chef. It's worth reading this post on the [History of the Facebook Chef Cookbooks](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/04/15/core-data/facebook-chef-cookbooks/) and watching this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YtZiVxEiJ8) made by Phil Dibowitz when the code was open sourced. I've also created some [video training](https://www.oreilly.com/videos/learning-chef-for/9781491959442/) on the basics of this attribute-driven approach that is worth browsing, if you have an O'Reilly Media Subscription.
